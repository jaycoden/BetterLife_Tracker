# 🎉 Your Life OS Desktop Apps Are Ready!

I've created two desktop apps for you:

## On Your Desktop:

1. **Life OS.app** - Launches your Life OS
2. **Stop Life OS.app** - Stops the server when you're done

## How to Use

### Starting Life OS

1. **Double-click "Life OS.app"** on your Desktop
2. Wait a few seconds (you'll see a notification)
3. Your browser will open automatically to http://localhost:3000
4. Start using your Life OS!

### Stopping Life OS

1. **Double-click "Stop Life OS.app"** when you're done
2. You'll see a notification confirming it stopped
3. The server will shut down

## First Time Use

**Before you can use the app, you need to configure it:**

### Quick Setup (5 minutes):

1. Open `QUICK_START.md` in this folder
2. Follow the Firebase setup (Step 1)
3. Get your Anthropic API key (Step 2)
4. Edit `.env.local` with your credentials (Step 3)
5. Now you're ready to launch!

## Important: First Launch Security

The first time you double-click "Life OS.app", macOS might say:

> "Life OS.app cannot be opened because it is from an unidentified developer"

**To fix this:**

1. Right-click (or Control-click) on "Life OS.app"
2. Select "Open"
3. Click "Open" in the dialog
4. This only needs to be done once!

Do the same for "Stop Life OS.app" if needed.

## Bookmarking

Once Life OS is running:

1. Visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser
2. Create your account
3. **Bookmark the page** (⌘+D)
4. Drag the bookmark to your Bookmarks Bar for quick access

## Daily Workflow

**Morning:**
1. Double-click "Life OS.app"
2. Click your bookmark
3. Complete your daily check-in!

**Evening:**
1. Close the browser tab
2. Double-click "Stop Life OS.app"

## Troubleshooting

### App won't open
- Right-click → Open (first time only)
- Check the security dialog

### Server won't start
- Make sure `.env.local` is configured
- Check `lifeos.log` file in the project folder

### Browser doesn't open automatically
- Manually open: http://localhost:3000
- Bookmark it for next time

### Server already running
- The app will detect it and just open your browser
- No duplicate servers will start

## Making It Even Better

### Add to Dock
1. Drag "Life OS.app" to your Dock
2. Now you can launch it from anywhere!

### Startup on Login (Optional)
1. Open System Preferences → Users & Groups
2. Click "Login Items"
3. Drag "Life OS.app" to the list
4. Your Life OS will start automatically when you log in!

### Custom Icon (Optional)
1. Find an icon you like (or screenshot an emoji)
2. Right-click "Life OS.app" → Get Info
3. Click the icon in the top-left corner
4. Press ⌘+V to paste your new icon
