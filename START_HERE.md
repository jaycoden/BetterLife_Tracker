## 📅 SMOKE TRACKER CALENDAR - How It Works

### Visual Guide:
```
✓ = Smoke-free day (GREEN background)
✗ = Smoked that day (RED background)
🔵 = Today (BLUE ring)
```

### How to Use:
1. **Calendar auto-fills** with ✓ marks from quit date to today
2. **Click any day** to toggle between ✓ and ✗
3. **Be honest!** Click today if you smoked today
4. **Streak counter** = consecutive ✓ days from today backwards
5. **Money saved** = Streak × $8/day (your $40 per 5 days)

### Example:
```
If your calendar shows:
Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun
 ✓   ✓   ✗   ✓   ✓   ✓   ✓

Your streak = 4 days (Thu-Sun)
Because it stops at the ✗ on Wednesday
```
